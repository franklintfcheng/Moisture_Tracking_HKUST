# Lagrangian moisture tracking diagnostics

**Code Developer:** Dr. Franklin Tat Fan Cheng (franklin.cheng@ust.hk)

**Affiliation:** Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)

**Description**  
This repository consists of the source codes for the backward **`WaterSip`** and forward **`WaterDrip`** diagnostics based on the particle output position (`partpositXXXX`) from [FLEXPART](https://www.flexpart.eu/) simulations. 

**Usage**  
- To perform moisture tracking, go to `moisture_tracking.m`. Adapt paths/parameters to your needs.

- To plot the backtracked moisture source, go to `flexpart_tutorial.m`. Adapt paths/parameters to your needs.
  
- The programs were all written in Matlab (ver 2023a).


**Updates** 

*-- July 5, 2024 --*
1. Added AR-related moisture contribution in WaterSip diagnostic (`Pm_AR`)
2. Minimized the hard-coded portions from `moisture_tracking.m` and `flexpart_tutorial.m`
